### What is ASCII?

ASCII stands for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**

#### ASCII Art

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together, ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages. Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, like on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation.

You can place it into a `HMTL` file, usually in a `<pre>` tag.
