# Computer Science fundamentals in 30 days (or more)

## Description

This repository contains the basic fundamental concepts of computer science. My goal is to learn and understand the basic concepts of computer science in 30 days. I will be updating this repository daily with the concepts I learn.

Some of topics are big and will take more than a day to learn, and I don't want to learn it in a hurry and under pressure, cuz that would have ruined the whole purpose and joy of learning. Also I won't be covered all topics, so below is the list of topics I think it's important for frontend developers to know.:

The resources I will be using to learn are:

1. [Cambridge iGCSE Computer Science](https://revise.learnlearn.uk/app/dashboard/7)
2. [Cambrige IGCSE Computer Science - YT Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYJ6oM_78KIP7NYKnP_KJ6lDPMhmpYVgA)

Main language I will be using is JavaScript, but I will be using Python for some topics.
